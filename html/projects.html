                <h1>Projects and Events</h1>
                <p>Merina Gray Ministry has been a driving force in the homeless community for over 10 years. The ministry has consistantly provided many free services to the homeless through the use of donations from the public and through partnerships with many similar organizations. The following are some of the more prominent programs offered to the homeless population over the years.</p>

                <h1>Occupation Assistance</h1>
                <p>One of the main reasons our members have become homeless is due to a hard time finding employment for themselves. Our occupation assistance program works with our partners and local businesses to provide a second chance to members of our community who have found themselves down on their luck. Our goal is to transition struggling members of the community into productive members of society.</p>

                <h1>Haircut Services</h1>
                <p>Our ministry is proud to provide vouchers for monthly haircut services including basic haircuts, beardtrimming, and conditioning. We work closely with local barbers to provide fair and free service to all of our ministry members. We have helped many successful members become employed at the same barbershops to, in turn, give back to our community.</p>

                <h1>Group Counseling</h1>
                <p>Psychological issues are a large driving factor in contributing to homelessness. Our group counseling service provides a productive space for both our homeless population and former homeless to come together and assist each other in getting back on their feet. Often our members feel powerless to relieve their situation, and our ministry works hard to give our members the mental tools required to start their journey back into society.</p>
